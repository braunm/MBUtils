Description: Various helpful utilities.  Defines a  pattern so knitr can recognize R code chunks defined in an Rcode LaTeX environment.  This pattern is a replacement for the Sweave style of <<>>= and @. Defining Rcode in this way is useful when writing in emacs, because the preview-latex package can then be configured to ignore code chunks entirely.
