```{r}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = FALSE,
  eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```




This file should compile with render() without any modifications.
This is here to test support for legacy files (i.e., nothing is
broken).

If it doesn't work, try running `pat_md()` to get the knitr pattern.

```{r}
A <- list(x=1, y=3)
A
```

Now some math:

$$
1+1=2\\
\alpha+\beta=5
$$
